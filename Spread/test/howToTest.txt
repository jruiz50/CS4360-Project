How to test in Flutter

Libraries:
    flutter_test
        Flutter ships with the flutter_test library which encapsulates all older Flutter test libraries. It can be used
        for Integration testing, Widget Testing and Unit Testing.

        Unit Testing: Tests a method or class. (Non-rendering code)

        Widget Testing: Verifies the behavior of widgets without running the app.

        Integration Testing: End to end testing, it runs the entire app.


    Mockito
        Is a based on the popular Java Library Mockito. It provides a means of
        creating mocks, fakes, behavior verification, and stubbing.

        For examples and tutorials please see:  https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito

        Installing Mockito:
            flutter pub add mockito

            Imports:
            import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';
            import 'package:mockito/annotations.dart';

        Installing build_runner:
            dart pub add build_runner --dev


Widget Testing
    Start by creating a file in the 'test' folder, name by page_test.dart
    add all needed imports including the page your testing.

    import 'dart:io';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
    import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';  <---- Only needed if you need mocks/fakes etc.
    import 'package:mockito/annotations.dart'; <---- Only needed if you need mocks/fakes etc.


    All test files will begin with:

         void main(){
            //Your Code will go in here
        }

        Now each page will have a group of tests associated with it.
        With in main, create a group.
        Where the description is the page name your testing. Ex. group('loginView',(){});

        void main(){
            group('Description'(){

            }
            // This is where all tests will be written

            });
          }


        Every widget test will generally start the same.
        By using the function testWidgets(). It can be used to test both built in and custom widgets
        as well as stateless or stateful widgets.
        It has a  number of optional inputs, but the most important ones for us will be,
        the description, future Function, and the skip Function.

        skip is a boolean value and can be used to skip the test if need be.
        Other wise a test stub will look like this

        void main(){
                group('Description'(){

                }
                testWidgets('What your testing', (WidgetTester tester) async{
                    await test.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(
                        home: yourPage(),
                    ));
                }
                });
              }
        You'll notice a few interesting things here, the first being (WidgetTester tester).
        Now 'tester' can be any name you chose, but this is
        object that will allow you to interact with the app throughout the test.

        The next interesting part, is the 'async' because tests are essentially futures,
        'async' is required.

        Next we have the 'await tester.pumpWidget()',
        pumpWidget() is the function that will render the given page and its components.
        pumpWidget() takes a <Widget> as its argument. In out case it will be a
        MaterialApp() because we are using Material UI Widgets.
        And we specify the page to be loaded by declaring our 'home:'.
